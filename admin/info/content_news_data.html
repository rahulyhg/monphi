<h2>News Data</h2>
The news data is intended to be used in three pieces. The primary page is handled in the engine itself while a "News Page" will be a primary news display site such as a page titled news.html or the main website.
<br />
The "News Page" would show the most recent content and have the ability to display a handful of short teasers with the latest content. 
<br />
The news archive is another page that shows the entire collection of news articles. You have the option to toggle when you want the news article to be listed in the archive. The idea behind the "List in News Archive" is to allow you to decide when you want the archive displayed. You can uncheck the "Show on News Page" option and select the List in News Archive, effectively moving the article into the archive and removing it from the primary news page.
<br /><br />

<b>Show on News Page</b> - Check this to have the news article displayed on the the primary news page. Display of the page can vary with the options below. This would be the News index page or your websites index page.
<br /><br />

<b>List in News Archive</b> - This will display the news article in the news archive page. (News archive page must be created for this to be checked).
<br /><br />

<b>Display "page title" as the news title</b> - Takes the "page title" from the main content and uses it while displaying on the short news articles articles or the news page.
<br /><br />

<b>Use the New Content Below on news page</b> - Shows "news content" in the news page.
<br /><br />

<b>Read More Link</b> - Display read more link to primary news content. It would be best to not use this feature and set a more descriptive link in the news content section
<br /><br />

<b>News Content</b> - This is the "teaser" box which would be a short blurb about your article that is displayed on the "News Page".
