	<b><u>About the Monphi CMS</u></b><br />
	The Monphi CMS is a Content Management System that was created to simplify the design and mofication time of website design and deployment.

	<br /><br />

	<b>Templates</b> can easily be created, existing or new webpages can be used as a template with the minor addition of blocks. The templates consist of HTML and simple bracketed blocks where dynamic content will be placed. The primary content is placed in the <b>&#91;content&#93; block</b>. Additional blocks can be added inside the content block with custom modules.

	<br /><br />

	Your content is stored in an underlying <b>MySQL database</b>. The Monphi CMS requires two database accounts: one for basic reading and a second for content management. The idea is to add an additional layer incase the code isn\'t up to security necessities.

	<br /><br />

	The engine was initially designed to work with Apache and <b>Mod rewrite</b>. Using mod rewrite we can funnel all of the websites input through the engine allowing us to define a variety of URL Aliases. A <b>URL Alias</b> allows us to name our webpages anything we want to. This is useful when converting existing web sites and keeping the same URL paths.
